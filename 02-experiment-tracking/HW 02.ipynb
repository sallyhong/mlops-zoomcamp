    "Tip 1: don't forget to wrap the training code with a `with mlflow.start_run():` statement as we showed in the videos.\n",

    "Now we want to manage the entire lifecycle of our ML model. In this step, you'll need to launch a tracking server. This way we will also have access to the model registry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to:\n",

    "* launch the tracking server on your local machine,\n",
    "* select a SQLite db for the backend store and a folder called `artifacts` for the artifacts store.\n",

    "We have prepared the script `hpo.py` for this exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to modify the script `hpo.py` and make sure that the validation RMSE is logged to the tracking server for each run of the hyperparameter optimization (you will need to add a few lines of code to the `objective` function) and run the script without passing any parameters.\n",
    "\n",

    "The results from the hyperparameter optimization are quite good. So, we can assume that we are ready to test some of these models in production. \n",
    "In this exercise, you'll promote the best model to the model registry. We have prepared a script called `register_model.py`, which will check the results from the previous step and select the top 5 runs. \n",
    "After that, it will calculate the RMSE of those models on the test set (March 2023 data) and save the results to a new experiment called `random-forest-best-models`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to update the script `register_model.py` so that it selects the model with the lowest RMSE on the test set and registers it to the model registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip 1: you can use the method `search_runs` from the `MlflowClient` to get the model with the lowest RMSE,\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip 2: to register the model you can use the method `mlflow.register_model` and you will need to pass the right `model_uri` in the form of a string that looks like this: `\"runs:/<RUN_ID>/model\"`, and the name of the model (make sure to choose a good one!).\n",

    "What is the test RMSE of the best model?\n",
